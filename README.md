This is an ongoing project where I am manually migrating [my current blog](http://www.codinghighway.com) into Jekyll.

I will make an announcement on my blog once the migration is complete.

## Note
I am aware that there's a Jekyll importer for wordpress. However, I decided to migrate everything manually for various reasons. It's an excuse to review all the content in my site, fix possible typos / mistakes, etc.
