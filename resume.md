## StackOverflow

My most updated resume can always be found on [my StackOverflow Careers profile](http://careers.stackoverflow.com/fgoncalves).

I believe that helping the community is the least I can do after everything I learned and keep learning online. This is why I am an avid StackOverflow participant, where I answer various questions, and occasionally ask some. Check [my StackOverflow profile](http://stackoverflow.com/users/2793118/filipe-goncalves).

## LinkedIn

You can also [find me on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/pub/filipe-gon√ßalves/5b/597/892). I'm not a huge fan of LinkedIn, and honestly, haven't invested much time in polishing my profile in there.
